# RREF Calculator for Linear Algebra
A reduced row echelon form calculator for matrices.

## Usage

* Create Matrix will create a 0 matrix with the number of rows and columns that are currently entered into the input fields.
* Random Matrix will create a matrix with random rows and columns and random entries.
* Reduce Matrix will output the input matrix's reduced row echelon form.
